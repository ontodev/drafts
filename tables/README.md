# The Trouble with Tables

Tables are great for lots of things.
We mainly work with:

- TSV (and CSV) files in directories, with version control
- spreadsheets: Excel and Google Sheets
- SQL databases

We want to move smoothly back and forth between these.
Once we can do that, we want some standard tools and workflows.
