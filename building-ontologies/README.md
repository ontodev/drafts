# Building OBO Ontologies

Our view of the past, present, and future of tooling and worflows
for ontology projects in the OBO community.
This includes "reference" ontologies in the OBO Foundry and OBO Library,
as well as "application" ontologies that make use of OBO terms
or prefer to follow OBO best practises.

This discussion informs the design of:

- [ROBOT](https://github.com/ontodev/robot)
- [DROID](https://github.com/ontodev/droid)
- [RDFTab](https://github.com/ontodev/rdftab.rs), [Wiring](https://github.com/ontodev/wiring.clj), [LDTab](https://github.com/ontodev/ldtab.clj)
- [Gizmos](https://github.com/ontodev/gizmos)
